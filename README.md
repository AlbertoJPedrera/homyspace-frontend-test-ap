# HomySpace Coding Test

Welcome to the HomySpace coding test!<br/>
In this test we want you to create a React App, building a Digital Library app.

## What do we want you to build

Inside the assets/ folder, you have some images for the guildelines of the UI. You don't have to build everything pixel by pixel, we better appreciate a cleaner code rather than a perfect UI.<br/>
However, please try to design and implement everything as similar as we provide.

· The App has three screens: Login, Discover and Read Books.<br/><br/>
· In the Login screen, any user can automatically Sign In. For this test, you don't have to build a Sign Up/Registration screen.<br/>
When the users signs in, they will be automatically redirected to the Discover page, the main screen.<br/>
Users can't access the App if they aren't logged in previously.<br/><br/>
· At the Discover screen, the user can search for books by Author. By default, this page is empty. It will only retrieve books when the user submits the search.<br/>
If they try to filter by two or more authors at the same time, only the first one will be filtered.<br/>
The returned results should be shown as it is illustrated in the screenshots.<br/>
Each book has a plus button at the right. If a user clicks this button, then they will add the book to their finished book list. The plus button will be replaced for a minus button in order to remove the book from the list it they press it.<br/><br/>
· The read books screen lists all the books they have read. They can also remove read books from here.<br/>
If an user comes back to the Discover screen, the last search state is preserved.<br/><br/>
· The user will have always a sidebar menu with the different pages that they can access.<br/>
Also, the username is always displayed at the top right corner of the screen, followed by a button to log out from the App.<br/><br/>
· You can get the data to display from the books.json

## What we are looking for

· Relax and enjoy! We're confident that you will build a great app.<br/>
· Try to develop your own components, please avoid using already made up ones.<br/>
· You can use and develop with third-party libraries. You don't have any restrictions, but be carefully as it will be part of the review process, and you'll probably have to defend why did you choose them.<br/>
· Spend some time with testing and making a good testable design.<br/>
· Reuse your code and components, keep your code clean and structured...<br/>
· The whole app needs to be responsive.<br/>
· Don't over-engineer the app!<br/>
· Don't forget that the job position is for React, so we will like to see a React solution for the test.

## One last thing...

Feel free writing a good README file where we can see how to run the code, how your app works, or include some kind of explanation that you want to add.<br/>
We also want to see your process taking actions and developing the app, not only the final result. Here, we appreciate incremental commits, to make reviews or pair programming when we have to develop some features. Don't be shy!
